## Backend of register, login, recoverPassword and logout

### REGISTER

As an anonymous user from the public area, I want to be able to register in the system in order to be able to authenticate myself and be able to perform functions as a member of the platform by indicating my username, e-mail address and access password.

### LOGIN

As an anonymous user I want to be able to log in to the platform to access the private area and thus be able to access all its features.

### RECOVER PASSWORD

As an anonymous user I want to be able to recover my password in case I forget it so that I can log in again in the private area.

### LOGOUT

Leave.
